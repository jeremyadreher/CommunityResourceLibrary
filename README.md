# CommunityResourceLibrary

Originally I was asked to develop a Resource Library for WorkSource Vancouver (Washington), to be easily accessible on the Resource Room computers. For reasons outside my control, it was never approved, so it was abandoned. However, I was able to export all the Weebly files, so I created a respository, where I can restructer the files into something meaningful.
